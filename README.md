put contents in steamapps/common/Quaver/Skins
then replace the images with your own (REMINDER THEY HAVE TO BE THE SAME FILE TYPE AND EXACT NAME)

for the modpack: i split it to three parts due to github's 25mb policy, we're running it on 1.20.1 and latest release of fabric (optionally also add "just enough items")

PS: **SOMEONE** FORGOT TO SEND ME THE LAST MOD, added it by itself so now it will die alone
update: it will not die alone
